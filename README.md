# Society
This project is a static website that presents the basic structure and user interface of a Society Management System. It is designed using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript, focusing on clean layout, user-friendly navigation, and responsive design. The website serves as a visual prototype that gives a clear idea of how a digital portal for housing society residents and administrators might look.

Home Page: Overview of society features, welcome message, and navigation links

About Page: Introduction to the society, objectives, and system purpose

Contact Us Page: Static form layout for users to get in touch with the society

Index Page: Acts as the main entry point with links to all pages

Technologies Used:

HTML5, CSS3

JavaScript for basic interactivity

Bootstrap for responsive design

Objective:
To create a frontend layout for a society management portal with basic informational pages that can later be expanded into a dynamic, fully functional web application.
